            <p class="first">Create your own affirmations, keep them organized with a clean, easy-to-use interface, and display them in fullscreen without distractions.</p>

            <p>Affirmations can be <span class="highlight">a life-transforming technique</span> for reprogramming your subconscious mind and the way you perceive yourself and the world.</p>

            <p>Having an affirmations practice consists in writing down personal, carefully worded affirmations <span class="highlight">that powerfully resonate with you</span>, and repeating them daily over long periods of time. This technique, as simple as it sounds, can have a massive impact on your daily life, from the way you perceive yourself and the world, to the way you behave and the decisions you make, with potentially massive long-term ramifications.</p>

            <p>With <span class="highlight">Affirmations</span>, you can have a dedicated app in which to store all your own personal affirmations, keep them organized in folders and display them in fullscreen with a large font. Editing, sorting and moving affirmations around is also easy and intuitive.</p>

        <div id="faq">

            <ul>
            <li><h3>What is an affirmation?</h3>

                <p>An affirmation is a short, carefully worded statement that you repeat over and over in order to instill it into your subconscious mind. Affirmations are typically in the present tense, starting with "I am", but they can be literally anything you want. The best affirmations are usually the most personal, with words that resonate with you the most, and addressing specific things in your life.</p>

            </li>

            <li><h3>Subconscious mind? Sounds woo-woo and new-agey. Do affirmations really work?</h3>

                <p>I won't try to convince you that affirmations actually work. You have to decide yourself. I made this app first and foremost for myself because I've witnessed first-hand the power of affirmations in my own life. In my personal experience, along with visualization and other self-help techniques, my affirmation practice turned out to be one of the most powerful self-help techniques I've ever come across.</p> <p>The power of writing down a series of carefully worded affirmations and repeating them constantly over long periods of time can't be overestimated. Think about it, what you repeatedly put in your mind is what determines how you view yourself and the world around you, how you tend to react to life events and situations, the decisions you make and so on.</p> <p>Of course you can't just repeat an affirmation for five minutes and expect results. The practice must be done constantly for long periods of time, preferably on a daily basis, and obviously there has to be a certain level of motivation behind it. In other words, you can't just repeat affirmations like a zombie and expect them to do anything for you. But, if done properly, the cascade effect of doing such practice in the right way can be extremely effective in the long run.</p>

            </li>

            <li><h3>Where do I get affirmations?</h3>

                <p>While they might be valuable for someone, I don't believe in those apps and sites that give you an existing list of affirmations, for the reasons I explained above. So my app doesn't have any. You have to create them yourself.</p> <p>I think the best affirmations come from your own intuition, and they are highly personalized, addressing specific things in your own life. It's your job to come up with powerful affirmations designed to lift you up, to reframe any problems or negative situations you might have in your life in order to improve your perception of them, to reshape your self-image, or to remind yourself of things to be grateful for in your life (a proven way to increase your happiness level), and so on.</p> <p>Your imagination is the limit. Affirmations are a flexible tool which can be applied to any areas of life in any way you want.</p>

            </li>

            <li><h3>Why this app?</h3>

                <p>Until recently, for my affirmations I always used my note-taking app, but as I started to create increasingly specific affirmations for every area of my life, the lists started to become long and things started to get quite messy. I also imagined that my practice would be more effective if I could read every single affirmation on its own, in fullscreen and with a big font. It has a different effect than just reading it in a list. I also wanted to be able to easily organize the affirmations in separate folders, and easily edit them with a simple and clean interface. </p>

                <p>Some of the apps I found searching around did some of this, but they either lacked some feature or they were badly implemented. None of them had a clean UI I liked and they weren't easy and straightforward to use. Easy editing ability turned out to be crucial, as I'm constantly refining my affirmations as my life keeps evolving. For example, affirmations can always be improved and made more specific, and old affirmations frequently become obsolete or less important, and need to be trashed or moved somewhere else in the list. </p>

                <p>So considering all this, in the end I decided to make an app myself, exactly as I needed it.</p>

            </li>

            <li><h3>Is the app free?</h3>

                <p>Yes, the app is free, but it has a (hopefully not too intrusive) banner in the main list view, which can be removed forever for the price of a coffee. Just to be clear, I'm not a fan of ads myself, but I wanted to keep the app free, so anyone can try it and use it, while still being able to monetize it, since it still took time and effort to develop and I will continue to update it over time. </p>

            </li>

            <li><h3>Will you add new features over time?</h3>

                <p>While the purpose of the app is pretty simple and the basic functionality is pretty much there, I will be adding new features over time in future updates, and as I keep using the app daily myself, I'll be constantly looking for ways to improve it.</p>

            </li>
